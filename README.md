# Air-Traffic-Control-Analysis-Network-
This repository contains the code and analysis for the FAA's air traffic control network, constructed from the Preferred Routes Database of the FAA's National Flight Data Center (NFDC). The nodes in this network represent airports or service centers, and the links are created from strings of preferred routes recommended by the NFDC.
